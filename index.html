                <p>The One Ring is one of the most powerful artefacts ever created in Middle Earth.</p>
                <p>It was crafted by the Dark Lord Sauron thousands of years ago in the fires of Mount Doom, during the Second Age. Sauron meant to use it to enhance his own power as well as to control all of the other rings of power.</p>
